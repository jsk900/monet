        Was born the 14 November 1840  and died the 5 December 1926. He was a
        French painter and the founder of French Impressionist painting and the
        most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy
        of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied
        to Plein air landscape painting.The term "Impressionism" is derived from
        the title of his painting Impression, Soleil Levant (Impression,
        Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent
        exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to
        the Salon de Paris. Monet's ambition of documenting the French
        countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many
        times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the
        seasons. From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny, where he purchased a house
        and property and began a vast landscaping project which included lily
        ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In 1899,
        he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a
        Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series of
        large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next
        20 years of his life.
